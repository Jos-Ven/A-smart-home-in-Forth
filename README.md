# A-smart-home-in-Forth

This project contains the Web-server-light.

The Web-server-light is used to make a smart home that runs local under Forth.
The cloud or an IOT-hub are not needed.
Just run Forth with a webserver and connect it to a wifi router.

The aims for the web-server-light_v50 are:
1. To be able to run a smart home by using a wireless UDP or TCP connection.
2. Exchange data.
3. Keep all data local.

The Web-server-light runs best under Linux on a Raspberry Zero W.
A PC with Linux (Bookworm) or PC with Windows10/11 can also be used.

Read the Installation guide for the details.
Here is how a smart home may look:
