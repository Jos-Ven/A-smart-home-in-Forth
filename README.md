# A-smart-home-in-Forth

When you make a smart home with Forth you are in full control. 
An IOT-hub is also not needed.  
Just run Forth with a webserver on your devices and connect them to a wifi router. 
To prevent all kinds of security risks I do not make any connection over the internet to my home.
